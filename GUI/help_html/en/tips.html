    <h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
    <p>
        Here we have gathered some tips to help make your experience with the program as comfortable as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Similarity Threshold</b> in the program settings plays a significant role. This is the value from which the compared image pairs will be added to the results table. Based on our experience, most truly similar images have a similarity percentage of 90 and above, so we recommend setting this value in the settings. Increasing this value speeds up the program, as fewer pairs are added to the results table. This also reduces your time for processing the results. However, do not set this threshold too high, as some genuinely similar images might be missed. If your goal is to find completely identical images, be sure to set the similarity threshold to 100 â€“ this will significantly speed up the comparison process.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Choosing Hashing Methods</b> increases the time the program takes to compare images. For finding similar images, selecting one of the proposed hashing methods is sufficient. Selecting all hashing methods increases both the program's runtime and the accuracy of the search.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are dissatisfied with the slow performance of the program when displaying images as thumbnails, you can use an alternative display option. To do this, you need to reduce the number of images displayed as thumbnails in the settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the program for black-and-white images or grayscale images is not recommended, as the comparison results may be inadequate. We are working on this and hope to address it in one of the next versions.
